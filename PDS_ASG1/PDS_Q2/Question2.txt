Explain what kind analysis has become easier with each of the visualizations?
In this analysis, several visualizations were created to explore different aspects of student performance. A pie chart illustrated the distribution of lunch types among students, highlighting preferences for various meal options. A scatter plot was employed to examine the relationship between reading and writing scores, allowing for the observation of any potential correlations between the two. Additionally, a bar graph depicted the distribution of writing scores, providing insights into how students' performances varied across different score ranges. A histogram was utilized to showcase the overall distribution of percentages, making it easier to identify trends and central tendencies within the dataset. Lastly, a hexbin joint plot was used to analyze the relationship between overall percentage and reading scores, revealing areas of concentration and potential correlations in student performance. Together, these visualizations facilitate a deeper understanding of the factors influencing student outcomes.
